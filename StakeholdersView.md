Stakeholders view
===

In a large open source project like Nodejs, multiple types of stakeholders can be identified. 
Table 1 introduces the stakeholders involved in the Nodejs project.

<br>

|Stakeholder class    |Description
| --------   | -----
|Acquirers    |The Node.js project is sponsored by the Node.js Foundation. As the corporate steward of Node.js, co-founder of the Node.js Foundation, and one of its largest-scale production users, Joyent, a provider of modern, open cloud infrastructure as a service which is also a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung, is uniquely equipped to deliver the highest level of support for powerful application frameworks and APIs.
|Communicators    |The Community Committee is a top-level committee in the Node.js Foundation focused on community-facing efforts. The Community Committee reflects a formal role in the governance of the Node.js project. The formation of this group as a committee alongside the Technical Steering Committee (TSC) demonstrates that community-focused contributions are valued by the contributors of Node.js.
|Development & Testing    |The project is governed jointly by the Technical Steering Committee (TSC), who is responsible for high-level guidance of the project. TSC consists of key Collaborators who have demonstrated both technical expertise critical to the ongoing maintenance and evolution of the project and a long-term commitment to driving the project and community forward.
|Suppliers    |Nodejs is built upon Java and Chrome V8. The platform of Nodejs is based on Chrome JavaScript runtime. Its testing framework is Mocha, which can provide high quality of testing.
|Support    |Core Working Groups and Users are part of the support staff. This support is mostly provided through the Nodejs repository.
|Users    |Nodejs has a very broad user base which can be separated into three categories: individual programmers, who use node.js to build their own pages, small projects needing insights into their builds, and companies. Whatâ€™s more, as predominately developers, users can make change to this framework to their use, which can be considered as system administrators of their own project.
|Competitors    |Other parties delivering similar services are for example Web Browser.
|Maintainers    |The in-house developers together with the Nodejs community of users, contribute to the maintenance of the system. Overall, Ryan Dahl and Ben Noordhuis seem to invest the most effort in maintaining the project.

The stakeholders are visualized in Figure 1, their respective power and interest in the Gradle project are shown in Figure 2.

In the stakeholder analysis, many different actors with different roles, power and interest have been analysed and visualised in Figure 2.<br>

The main stakeholder of Nodejs is Joyent, which is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Samsung. In the late 2011, Node was funded by cloud computing service Joyent, and founder Ryan Dahl joined Joyent to take full responsibility for Node's development.

As Node.js Foundation is sponsoring this project, so the Node.js Foundation must be quite interested with its trade tendency, which is quite related with its financial interest. Also, with contributing money to this project, Node.js Foundation can make the trademark guidelines of the Node.js project, so Node.js Foundation is of great interest and also power in the project.

Since TSC members are responsible for top level technical community concerns. The role is mostly administrative and is responsible for admitting new Top Level Projects, Top Level Working Groups, and advocating for any needs in the technical side of the foundation to the Node.js Foundation Board of Directors. So developers and testers have much interest on nodejs project, but without too much power on making the future direction decision of nodejs.

Suppliers may have a little interest of the using outlook of nodejs, since it may enlarge its reputation of good quality.The two least powerful stakeholders are the competitors and the individual users. However, competitors are quite interest in this project, since they are rivals, who should keep a closed eye on each other.
